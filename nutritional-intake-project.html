                <p>This project aimed to uncover the relationship between nutrient intake during early childhood and cognitive development, a critical period where the brain grows to 80-90% of its adult size. Recognizing that enriched environments and proper nutrition are pivotal for positive brain development, our study sought to comprehensively explore dietary impacts on cognitive functions in children aged 1-3 years. The research employed a multifaceted approach, assessing dietary quality, individual nutrients, and deriving novel dietary patterns to understand their association with cognitive growth. The approach was further extended to discover the effects of nutritional dietary intake on temperament development.</p>

                    </header>

                    <p>The analysis began with organizing a vast dataset and progressed through building various statistical models to decode the association between nutritional intake and cognitive functions from various perspectives. The methodology unfolded as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            <li><b>Exploratory Analysis: </b> Initially dealing with 168 nutrient features, we refined this to 157 after excluding those with excessive zeros. Given the complexity of the dataset and the modest sample size (approximately 200 observations and 100 subjects in each age bin), direct analysis using all nutrients was impractical due to high dimension relative to sample size and high correlation among many nutrients (see <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>).</li>
                            <figure class="image60" id="Figure1">

                            </figure>
                        </p>
                        <p><li><b>Dimension Reduction Strategy: </b> To manage the high dimensionality, we opted for dimension reduction, achievable through feature selection or extracting latent features. XGBoost played a crucial role in this phase, enabling feature selection via its feature importance scores. This step was crucial for narrowing down the focus to the most significant nutrients for further analysis. It also uncovered the potential significance of some nutrients not initially scoped as of interest by our collaborative research teams, providing valuable insights. However, this approach had its limitations, potentially overlooking the comprehensive interplay of nutrients on cognitive development due to the narrowed focus.</li></p>
                        <p><li><b>Comprehensive Analytical Approaches: </b> Aiming to capture a holistic view of dietary impacts on cognitive development, we implemented the analysis in three parts, each utilizing linear mixed-effect models to estimate and identify significant associations between nutritional intake features and cognitive functions:
                        <ul>
                            <p><li><b>Index-based Approach: </b> This method evaluated dietary quality using Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores, providing a straightforward assessment based on dietary guidelines.</li></p>
                            <p>
                                <li><b>Univariate Approach: </b> Focused on the impact of individual nutrients on cognitive functions, this approach allowed for the examination of specific nutrient effects in isolation. Given the hierarchical structure of the nutrients reported by NDSR, they were grouped into four layers of analysis (see <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>).</li>

                            <p><li><b>Data-driven Approach: </b> Adopted without strong prior assumptions, this method utilized machine learning (EGA - Exploratory Graph Analysis) and factor analysis (CFA - Confirmatory Factor Analysis) methods to uncover patterns and associations that might not be immediately apparent, offering a holistic view of dietary impacts on cognitive development.</li></p>
